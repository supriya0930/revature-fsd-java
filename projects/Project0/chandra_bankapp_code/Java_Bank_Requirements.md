# Bank

## Description

   The Bank app is a console-based application that simulates banking operations. A customer can apply for an account, view their balance, and make withdrawals and deposits. An employee can approve or deny accounts and view account balances for their customers.
	
## Purpose

   We want to see that you can meet deadlines and that you can code. You are expected to complete the following requirements and give a 5 minute presentation of your project to our QC team.

## Requirements
1. Functionality should reflect the below user stories.
2. Data is stored in a database.
3. Data Access is performed through the use of JDBC in a data layer consisting of Data Access Objects.
4. All input is received using the java.util.Scanner class.
5. Log4j is implemented to log events to a file.
6. A minimum of 10 JUnit test is written to test some functionality.


## User Stories

* As a user, I can login.
* As a customer, I can register with the bank using First Name, Last Name, Email and Password.
* As a customer, I can apply for a new bank account with a starting balance.
* As a customer, I can view the list of accounts I own.
* As a customer, I can view the balance of a specific account.
* As a customer, I can make a withdrawal or deposit to a specific account.
* As the system, I reject invalid transactions.
	* Ex:
		* A withdrawal that would result in a negative balance.
		* A deposit or withdrawal of negative money.
* As a customer, I can view the transactions in a specific account.
* As an employee, I can approve or reject an account.
* As an employee, I can view a customer's bank accounts.
* As a employee, I can register for a customer account.
* As a customer, I can post a money transfer to another account.
* As an employee, I can view transactions done by the customers account.
* As a user, I can logout.



## Project Evaluation Parameters
1. Your project will be evaluated based on coverage of technology rather than the user stories.
2. How well you present, naming conventions, separation of code into various classes, how well have you applied OOP and design patterns.
3. So you could focus less on user stories and more on coverage of things/technologies which you learnt during the training.
